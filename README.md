# fs-teacher-chatbot
In this workshop, you will continue to learn more about JavaScript strings by building a chatbot.

You will learn how to work with template literals, and the indexOf method.

Step 1
In this workshop, you are going to continue learning about strings by building a Teacher Chatbot.

To begin, add a console statement, with the message of "Hi there!".

Step 2
Now it is time to set the bot's name.

Create a variable called botName and assign it the string value of "teacherBot".

Step 3 Passed
Now it is time to create a greeting using the botName variable.

In the previous lecture videos, you learned how to concatenate strings using template literals like this:

Example Code
const name = "John";

// "Hello, John!"
`Hello, ${name}!`;
Start by creating a variable called greeting.

Next, using template literal syntax, assign a string that says My name is, followed by the botName variable, and ending with a period (.).

Finally, log the greeting variable to the console.
